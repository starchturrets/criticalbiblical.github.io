### Preliminary Considerations

- We are collaborating on this project using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/MYuZmBM4/critical-biblical-website).
- Would serve as a space to publish academic blog entries from Biblical scholars involved with Critical Biblical
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4o0ESGrauyQYjZ5OyzjZIg) |
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CriticalBiblical) | [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/CriticalBiblical/).
Initially, I would have the scholars submit blog articles to me through email. Then I would, manually, create the pages my self.
This process could be developed further over time to allow scholars to have their own accounts, etc.
- At some point, we would want to sell merchandise (t-shirts, hats, etc.) in order to raise funds in addition to Patreon.
